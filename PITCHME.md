## What is GraphQL?

"GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs"

Created by Facebook in 2015.

GraphQL is a **language specification**, not a lib/framework. There are some implementations, in different languages.

In this presentation, I'll use **Apollo** JavaScript implementation.

## GraphQL vs REST

It's not correct to compare both, because the usage is different, even if there are some usage intersections. REST is an architectural style for creating Web services when GraphQL is mostly used as a BFF and/or to unify multiple sources of data for multiple targeted devices.

You could have, for example, a GraphQL server that exposes data from REST APIs, and ElasticSearch cluster, and MySQL database etc...

You could also use a GraphQL server in place of a REST API.
