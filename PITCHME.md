## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, created by Facebook in 2015.

GraphQL is a **language specification**, not a lib/framework. There are some implementations, in different languages.

## GraphQL vs REST

@color[orange](We should not compare them, because the usage is different, even if there are some usage intersections.)

@size[0.8em](REST is an architectural style for creating Web services when GraphQL is mostly used as a BFF and/or to unify multiple sources of data for multiple targeted devices.)

@size[0.8em](You could have, for example, a GraphQL server that exposes data from REST APIs, from an ElasticSearch cluster, from a MySQL database...)

## Three types only

* Query -> Read
* Mutation -> Create, Update and Delete
* Subscription -> Way to push data from server to client
